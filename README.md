### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Dom, I'm a semi-experienced developer based in England.
I currently tinker with projects, however one day I plan to work on a scaled project and/or starting up my own large project.

### Languages
At the moment, I'm fluent in C#, Java & JavaScript. I am currently learning beginner C++, however I hope to move on to intermediate when I'm ready.

### Projects
Currently, I have no previous projects, however I plan to start working on smaller projects to demonstrate my abilities. Check back soon :)
